            The most challenging part of any project which I have observed is even starting it.
            Once I start it the next big thing is Deciding which problem to solve. As a UX designer, we are
            driven by curiosity and a burning desire to solve problems. The more insights we uncover,
            the more problems we will identify — and the harder it becomes to settle on just one. During research and design phase
            i got into loop of deciding what to give more time and which to not. If i have focused on all parts of Cricbuzz app, it would not have
            been possible to finish it all in 2 days at all. So focusing only on Important stuff is very crucial.
