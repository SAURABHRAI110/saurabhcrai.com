        I was on the team for almost two years as the sole/lead designer. During that time I
        worked with company co-founders, developers, content-writers, designers to completely overhaul the
        design to create new  design system, create new features to fit our
        customers needs, and most importantly,
        design new features to create a better experience for every project I worked on. FT Event was one of the company Internal Project.
        <br><br>
        FT Event is about event website where user can book tickets and create event. 
        Using FT Events to the Beat website, users can register for the events, Book tickets,
        Create Event and manage the event or ticket
        from its dash board. In addition to finding information on past and future events,
        event results, image gallery, charity event organizers,
        participating musicians, register for the Feeding Trends exclusive advetisement, and more.

        <br>
        <br>
        
        Feeding Trends- Events is in Development stage right now, I delivered the design already,
      This casestudy is all about that. Because its in development stage, the final product most probably will be different from what  I designed.
      So lets hope, FT Events came as awesome as we have thought so. Shekhar and team is working really hard right now.

        and yet make it different. Got it! I hope mot. Well me too. Because Feeding Trends have a already existing website and brand guidlines.
        It was really challenging. The existing website and the event portal have different purpose and target user.

    <!--       When we work on something that we have to decide on our own about every aspects of a product. It gets more challenging than ever.
      Then we are in constant dilemma of this or that. Iteration seems to never stop. Its get frustrating.
      Though we are not restricted by anything, its also fun and our mind happen to work round the clock to make decisions.

        <br> <br>Making something stand out and gives a feel of creativity and wowness. 
        was cool for the moment but that can not be used to used on web.

      Also, there is many competitor in the same niche, and i was not easy to have something that is similar yet
      simple and intuitive and make user come to website and let them discover events and book tickets.

        phase. At the time I was also learning Basic HTML CSS. And leaning itb helps my to move forward fast as I communicated better with

            After layout and content strategy, It was time to set a
            theme and colour palette It was time to design a simple,
            clean and elegant showcase website. The accent colour I
            choose was Dark moderate cyan.. Later on while project was
            in design phase I chamged the theme from Cyan to Gradient feel,
            to make it more contrast and modern feel.
            I decided to use red as theme colour
