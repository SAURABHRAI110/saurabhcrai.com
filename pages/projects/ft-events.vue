      Founded in 2017, Feeding Trends is a young company that provides digital content and web-based
       industry solutions. The Feeding Trends website supports organizers with cost-effective event
       ticketing solutions and engages users through published articles and stories.

       <br>
       <br>
        I was part of the team for almost two years as the lead designer. During that time,
        I worked closely with the company’s co-founders, developers, content writers, and designers
        to completely overhaul the design, establish a new design system, and introduce features that
        aligned with customer needs. Most importantly, I focused on enhancing user experience across
        all projects I contributed to. One of the key internal projects I worked on was FT Event.
        <br><br>
        FT Event is an event platform where users can book tickets and create events.
        Through the FT Events website, users can register for events, purchase tickets, create
        and manage events, and oversee ticketing from a dedicated dashboard. Additionally, the platform
        provides access to information about past and upcoming events, event results, image galleries,
        charity event organizers, participating musicians, exclusive Feeding Trends advertisements, and more

        <br>
        <br>
        
        This case study captures the design work I delivered for FT Events five years ago.
        At that time, the platform was still in development, and the final product might have evolved
        from my initial designs. Looking back, I hope the project turned out as envisioned, and I
        appreciate the hard work Shekhar and the team put into bringing it to life.

        The idea was to make Feeding Trends to the Beat website as a one-stop-destination

    <!-- Backstory -->

    <pcase
      heading="Challenge"
      para="The biggest challenge was making the event portal feel connected to Feeding
      Trends while keeping it unique. Since Feeding Trends already had a website and brand
      identity, the event portal needed to blend in while standing out.

      <br>
      <br>

      Additionally, the event booking space is highly competitive, with many
      platforms offering similar services. The goal was to create something intuitive and
      simple yet engaging enough to attract users, encourage event discovery, and make ticket
      booking seamless. Balancing familiarity, uniqueness, and usability was the key challenge.

    <!--       When we work on something that we have to decide on our own about every aspects of a product. It gets more challenging than ever.
      Then we are in constant dilemma of this or that. Iteration seems to never stop. Its get frustrating.
      Though we are not restricted by anything, its also fun and our mind happen to work round the clock to make decisions.

        <br> <br>Making something stand out and gives a feel of creativity and wowness. 
        was cool for the moment but that can not be used to used on web.

      identified ways to monetize it. This helped us create a clear website structure and site map
      for a smooth experience.
        
        <br><br>
        From our past experience with Feeding Trends, we learned the challenges of building a
        content platform. To keep the design simple and scalable, we followed Google’s Material
        Design Guidelines, making development and implementation easier.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        After the initial findings and research, I decided to coordinate a Google Design Sprint to
        align the team on how we could encourage users to share events on other platforms while
        keeping the experience intuitive. I gathered people from product, engineering, customer success,
        and marketing for a 5-day sprint where we ideated, sketched, discussed, designed, and tested our
        concept with customers to gather real insights.

        it was about solving real problems and anticipating user needs. Every decision had a ripple effect
