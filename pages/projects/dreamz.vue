      <br>
      1. Define Idea in 5 sentence. <br>
      2. Vision of the product <br>
      3. What will success will look like after product design. <br>
      4. Technical constraint <br> <br>

      Question related to user as in App <br>
      1. Who can view user profile <br>
      5. Who can view user profile <br>
      3. Money Earned <br>
      4. Who can view money earned<br>
      and many more cross questioning in meetings, slack chat...
       <br> <br>

      Feels <br>
      1. Whenever a user donates amount he should feel some sense of accomplishment
      and make him feel good about a dream he just fulfills. So,
      how it can be done. One way is to make it personal. <br>
      2. Why should I feel some sense of accomplishment? What drives a person? So how can we make it personal?
      <br>
      3.  What is Really Happening in this app? Why someone even uses this app? There is just
      so much app already? People are getting so particular about what they want on their phone,
      and what they don't want in their phone. So, It comes to just one thing that is a need.

Ok, so how I say it. I am creating a dream Say it. I wanna buy a Gaming Mouse: For which I need 1000rs. So how I am getting it. <br>
I am investing 500rs and getting back 1000rs so in a sense I am earning 500rs. Really ? is this really happening?  <br>
<br>
There are 100 users: <br> 
Each creates their dream <br>
I donate 5rs <br>
Each donates me 5rs. SO 5x99=495. <br>
But there is limitation set. You need to step up your level. Nice move. So you got to invest to get more so to get more earning.

        Researching the competition is the best way to avoid unintentional plagiarism. It will give you an idea of common color

        Then I did analysis of colors, their perception and influence.
        Blue is one of the most commonly used colors when coming to product design.
        People use blue things so much they get a sense of familiarity already when its blue.
        The blue color is considered to give emotions such as trust, safe and relaxation.
        As their is money involved in app user should trust the app to do so. The light blue color
        creates the emotions such as calm and makes
        the user feels refreshed. The blue color is also associated with happiness. I added some green tone
        the blue to also standout among all those so many blue products.
        This is how I came up with the mood board.

        Finally, after all researches and analysis were done I focused on designing all the

        spacing and color to guide the user and designed visual, interactive elements that respond

          <p>
            Working on this project helped me learn that user research is crucial for the whole process
            of design application. Responsiveness is another important point in the UI/UX design.
            When the app shows the user immediate consequences of their action, there is a more personal connection.
            <br />
            <br />There are many people who support the idea that digital products of today should be minimalist
            and purely functional. However, my experience and practice shows that people want to both solve
            the problems and feel aesthetic satisfaction using apps. The balance of these things was my
            responsibility as UI/UX designer on this project.
            <br />
            <br />After i finished and look back again after someday felt proud of myself. Loved everything I did with it
            and the pressure in completing all these in just 10 days was immense. When I am given a challenge in
            situation similar I discovered myself I perform well.
