        needed and in the process enjoying each little wins. This project laid the foundation of whatever I am today. Kind of everything I did
        let it be designing App screen, Designing app icon, working with xdpi- xxdpi- mdpi images, prototyping everything, working with developers,
        working with a team of talented people, all I did was my first time. 
        <br> 
        <br>
        Pretty much it was people that were involved in creating a ecosystem that connects thousands of people. Creating a brands that people recognize and appreciate that can helps 
        students to share their talents and get involved. Creating an app might seem just a work of few people, but
        making it possible so that ot helps students is combined effort of a whole team. Well we ere 23 people having skills to make it possible.
        and we did.
