       This project was kind of very unique. It was to design whole Art book for Students from class 1 to 6.
       Total 12 books, Cover for them and Inside page like Index, Content and all those 60 page for colouring.
       It was my 3rd time dealing with design in book. I was confident I will be able to deliver it, but the thing was it was
       very daunting, so many pages and so many page just similar layout and all to be done in Illustrator.

      para="  The base file that I got from the client was all set in Corel Draw. They contain all the
        basic shapes and very basic layout and some content that would have to get in each page. I don't like Core Draw
        Personally and I got more command over Illustrator. So I choose to do the hard stuff, copying and pasting.
        I didn't have to draw vector images, well I could have not accepted this if not for that. Because 
        designing a book (so many books) is not a one man job.

      Anyway, here I was readjusting the artboard to mach the required size of book, and then vector
      images from Corel draw to Illustrator.
      I have to say It was very boring. After a week and two. It got worse, I could have done only
      40 pages and there were more around 400 pages, so asked help from my junior designer Abhishek, and he agreed,'
      to my expectations we both were able to do this in very less time.

      para="  I remember correctly, almost 2 years back, I was in the middle of the completing this project.
        I for some days travelled to  Gr. Noida for a break, and during that I lost my Laptop from my friends room. It was Disater, my lptop got stolen.
        3 years of stuff vanished just like that. Fortunately I have a habit of backing up things to cloud, and after some
        days I got myself to together and began working from my Old age Desktop Pc having a very slow i5 processor. 
        Projects got delayed to October and its all on me. Somehow  I made to the end. 

       
       
        <br><br>

        With all that in past, it was pretty tough experience. The project was boring, i hated working with Corel Draw,
        My laptop got stolen, lost 3 years of stuff, lost myself and then redeemed myself as I always do. Now I write these
        this project made me learn so much. About life, about people, about children about client-designer relationship and many more.

            Life is very unpredictable, you got to get backups of your work
            each day. Anything can happen anytime. Also when working on a projects that requires you to do the same stuff
            again and again its gets boring. Keeping it interesting and fun is an art each designer should learn the hard way.
