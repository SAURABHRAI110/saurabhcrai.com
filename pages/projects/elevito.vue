    Computer Science Engineering with some of my crazy friends who were so good in web development. Me and friend wanted
    to do something of our own, one night I got a chance to do it under the hat of one of my Senior. It was really mind bending
    for me and very challenging.
    <br />
    <br />
So here I was, crawling Pintrest, going through design agencies website, looking thirstily for some
    inspiration that could move me. After few days of this or that, I found a specific visual split in half and
    that's basically where the whole concept came from."

      Then we are in constant dilemma of this or that. Iteration seems to never stop. Its get frustrating.
      Though we are not restricted by anything, its also fun and our mind happen to work round the clock to make decisions.

        <br> <br>Making something stand out and gives a feel of creativity and wowness. 
        was cool for the moment but that can not be used to used on web.

            Elevito happen during my college time. It was my greatest learning
            curve. I tried everything that I can do. In the beginning we did not
            have many projects to showcase on the website, still somehow managed
            to show 15 Projects, out of which 2 projects was fictional. It took
            a lot of time like 2 months just on showcasing 15 projects, there
            were times when tt became very boring, couldn't give the best, but
            with all support and love, I never lost enthusiasm and maintained
            the excitement. Whenever challenge arrived, there were people whom I
            could lean on. This was all possible because each and everyone came
            together even in their busiest of time, even when exams were near.
