      including Yash Srivastava and me. Digital design was the primary motivation behind its creation.
      So we hapen to have some skills and passion for digital products design and developement.
      With little knowledge but a lot of enthusiasm for learning, we aimed to create a small agency where
      we could work together on digital products for the clients we onboarded.

    <!-- Backstory -->

    <pcase
      heading="The Making of Elevito"
      para="The idea of Elevito started in around 2017 while I was still pursuing Computer Science
      Engineering in Lucknow. Some of my friends were highly skilled in web development, and we all
      wanted to work on something meaningful together. One night, an opportunity came my way under
      the guidance of a senior, and we grabbed it.
    <br />
    <br />

    Coming up with the name Elevito was a challenge in itself. It was envisioned as a design
    company based in India, dedicated to delivering high-quality content that brands truly deserve.
    The journey began in my 7th semester of engineering when my friends and I decided to build something
    of our own.

    <br>
    <br>
So we started to envision how the Elevito brand would look. The first step as a designer was to create
its brand identity and start working on the website design. I spent days exploring Pinterest, Awwwards,
analyzing design agency websites, and searching for inspiration. After multiple iterations and creative
explorations, a split-layout visual caught my attention, forming the foundation of Elevitoâ€™s design concept.
<br>
<br>

It was an opportunity for us to challenge our creativity, without fixing
any constraint or barrier. "

    <!--       When we work on something that we have to decide on our own about every aspects of a product. It gets more challenging than ever.
      Then we are in constant dilemma of this or that. Iteration seems to never stop. Its get frustrating.
      Though we are not restricted by anything, its also fun and our mind happen to work round the clock to make decisions.

        <br> <br>Making something stand out and gives a feel of creativity and wowness. 
        was cool for the moment but that can not be used to used on web.

            Elevito happen during my college time. It was my greatest learning
            curve. At the start, we didnâ€™t have many projects to showcase, still somehow we managed
            to show 15 Projects, out of which 2 projects was fictional. It took two months just to
            curate and present them properly. There were times when the process felt monotonous,
            there were times when it became very boring, couldn't give the best, but
            with all support and love, I never lost enthusiasm and maintained
            the excitement. Whenever challenge arrived, there were people whom I
            could lean on. This was all possible because each and everyone came
            together even in their busiest of time, even when exams were near.
