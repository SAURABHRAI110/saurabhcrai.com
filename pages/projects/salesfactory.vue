      Making a awesome single page website on Angular.

    Coming up with a layout that work for both the company image and Aman as a person.
    When the person whom you are  making a website sit and watch you do design and code. I find this blessing but keeping
    my cool all the way is another challenge. Things get heated. You know.

      I started with the hero section of the website. Designed it then coded it in Angular with 
      pure CSS. I didn't see any point adding UI framework like Which my friend Insisted but I knew We don't need it.
      Moving forward we pretty much liked the hero section then. Moved to design a basic layout of product section.
      I used Icons from thenounproject.com and then editing its width, height, border in Adobe XD to make all Icons
      consistent through out the website. Every Icons assets used in Website is SVG. 
      <br><br>
      In all section I used Flex for implementing all those layouts, I initially thought using grid but the layout was simple. Flex was
      all that required and also there no problem making it all responsive. Wherever required I added media queries in images, font sizes and padding and margin.

      Enough getting into using tech terms. Lets just see the final website.

            It was really a Big project for us. Keeping a tight deadline. Keeping the Project direction on the right path was in itself a challnege.
            Their were times when we thought things will sort out in 2 3days but that took us months and It was just one thing.
            Meeting become stressful, people get demotivated. Keeping the Enthusiasm alive was the biggest challenge. We did it anywhow. This project was the one of its own kind.
            Greatest learning curve for all the team. For developers for designers for Project managers.

        The greatest challenge was not the project, but keeping the enthusiasm alive during all those times.
        I pretty much saw myself and people losing it but again rising with new energy to make all
        this possible. Thanks💚
