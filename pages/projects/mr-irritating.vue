      with some wonderful people whom I learned a lot on the way of designing a beautiful cover that is being loved
      by thousands and appreciated by  my teammates, Mr. Irritating Team and those who come around this novel.
      The novel narrates the story of three characters Kavya, Anant and Aashi and of course their friendship, career and love triangle between them."

      para="   Love it or hate it, the fact is people do judge a book by its cover.
               <br><br>Designing novel cover is both fun and challenging. Because the interiors of most novels are unadorned continuous typography I think you have to take a lot of care to balance the elements of the page to get the best effect.
                  Margins, line leading, choice of fonts get more critical since the aim of the designer is to enable the reader to be carried along by the author's story. <br><br>

          We came to conclusion that the cover should be something that directly tell the brief about the romantic story. The novel should stand out and attracts passing by people when kept on shop. the colour, typography and character styling, their background story.

      It was important for me to design a cover that narrates the story in just

      para="  Anant is an ordinary shy boy hailing from Varanasi. He has just come to
Lucknow to pursue his engineering and finds everything very different to him. He never thought that this place would hold such an important place in his life.
While in his first semester, his eyes capture a girl who turned his world upside down. He’s gripped by love at first sight and begins to follow his desire for his beloved Aashi, blindly.
Every day, there is a round table discussion on love and it’s side effects. His
enthusiastic friends help him with their expert advices. Everything is very pleasant in the beginning.
With the passage of days, he manages to win her friendship but inside he was madly in love with her.
One of his close friends, Kavya happens to help him build his confidence and in the process, she falls for him.
After few days, he finds out that the girl he loved, already had a boyfriend and considers Anant a bit irritating. This breaks him. Anant actually loved her enough to let her go.
Kavya is senior to him, frank, bold and pure hearted girl, who had always been at Anant’s backend.
Anant resists forgetting Aashi, while Kavya is always ready to move mountains for him. Thus, Anant struggles between love,friendship and career. Mr. Irritating is the journey of the three, in pursuit of their true love. 
<br><br>
Is it so hard to win over your first love?
Will life never stop playing strange games?
Can love be found from unexpected places?
<br><br>
Well, somethings are better left unsaid. Love has its own way of troubling people. It is capable of making you and breaking you. Presenting to you a roller coaster ride with amazing twists and turns. 
Mr. Irritating shall not irritate you!"

          Aashi is deeply loved by Mr. Irritating. She is a sweet and bubbly girl, with limited friends.
          She has a reserved nature and looks beautiful in indian attires.
          As Anant confesses his love, she accepts it,
          becoming his strength through the thick and thin of collage life. However, in the end
          misunderstandings develop and she leaves him without a word.
