    my seniors, co-founded feeding trends. I was in 6th semester, enjoying some home time during summer vacation, got a call from
    Yash sir and I was asked to do a logo design for Feeding Trends. I remember it was a long call. Moving forward, logo designing
    is tough, I took my time and did textual logo, used a  Sans font, outlined it, played around arrow, to make it feel like 
    trendy stuff and yeah Finished. We moved forward with the logo design and updated the logo on Facebook, Instagram etc.
    FT got recognized and people started sharing our stuff and yeah it was great start.
    <br><br>
    Later on after 2 month I joined FeedingTrends while still managing my time around
    college and working at feeding Trends Office. Bunking classes just to work on outgoing
    projects at FT office or from my flat. It was Beginnings of something great.

            This project was very long, there was so many changes done one after
            one. So many iteration. Well after the development the website
            traffic increased. We reached to more and more people with time. The
            problem that was there before redesign was solved. The development
            team did a great job and took design even further and better with
            all the tweaking done from time to time.

        It is the people that makes everything worthwhile. I happen to work with
        some great people during design phase and later on during development
        phase as an audience. It was awesome.
