      After many meetings with between Amandeep sir (Entrepreneurs) and Project Manager (Yash Srivastava). Initial requirement that the team needed to do over a long

      what is what and how to move forward. Just I didn't knew challenges were awaiting for me on personal level.

            It was really a Big project for us. Keeping a tight deadline. Keeping the Project direction on the right path was in itself a challnege.
            Their were times when we thought things will sort out in 2 3days but that took us months and It was just one thing.
            Meeting become stressful, people get demotivated. Keeping the Enthusiasm alive was the biggest challenge. We did it anywhow. This project was the one of its own kind.
            Greatest learning curve for all the team. For developers for designers for Project managers.
