      Communication in large offices is a challenge, and booking some space to run
      a meeting or have a private call shouldnâ€™t be difficult. This project was a challenge to myself. I had to understood the porblem come up with
      a solution within 2 Days. It was to design a user interface
      for web platform to let someone know whether a meeting room is free, how long for,
      and allow the person to book on the spot if necessary. This application is intended
      for use by anybody who might need a meeting room in a large office. One should consider
      that the people requiring the room might need it urgently, there may already be people
      in the room, they might only need it for 10-15 minutes, and that there might be more
      than one meeting room in the building...

        This was an exciting project personally. In my past experience I whenever required took team
        meeting with developers, fellow designers, project managers, clients and whosoever needed to discuss the project
        give input on the design, Give ideas etc. Meetings are the very important part of the process, still
        designers, developers avoid it of possible, they hate to see their time wasted like. Meeting are considered a hindrance in the workflow.
        So, that people take meetings seriously and attend it on time and give their value to the subject.
        My thought process for this project move around this thing mostly.

        I came up with that meeting rooms should not be just about booking rooms, but more than this.
        It should be taken as an important part of the process and company culture where everyone feels

    <pcase
      heading="Problems"
      para="I talked with some of the friends who are working on corporate and attending meeting, discussing with team
    are their part of the job. I came up with some some conclusion and made me wonder. The conclusion's are as follows.
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul style='color:#7800FE;'>
      <li>Most of them hate attending meeting. They consider it as unnecessary.</li>
      <li>70 percent of them considered it as wastes of time period.</li>
      <li>Most developers said it make them to lose focus from their task specially if the meeting is in mid hours of working time.</li>
      <li>Most of them doesn't event get to know what their contribution to the meeting will be.</li>
      <li>Even if they know, they lack clarity and what they have to contribute to meeting.</li>
      <li>Most meeting turned out to get delayed and even they get cancelled and they get to know after their time have been already wasted.</li>
      <li>The meeting room they get into doesn't have what they required like wi-fi password.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    Considering all these I came up with a solution that can solve all these with just one product i.e. MeetingRooms
    Not only book your rooms for meeting but also provide details related to meeting, who will going to attend the meeting and what they are expected 
    to come up in meeting.

            After layout and content strategy, It was time to set a
            theme and colour palette It was time to design a simple,
            clean and elegant showcase website. The accent colour I
            choose was Dark moderate cyan.. Later on while project was
            in design phase I chamged the theme from Cyan to Gradient feel,
            to make it more contrast and modern feel.
            I decided to use red as theme colour
