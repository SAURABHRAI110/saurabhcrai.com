      to navigate, Lots of technical words without much context which frustrated
      many target users. This caused a normally enjoyable experience to become

            After layout and content strategy, It was time to set a
            theme and colour palette It was time to design a simple,
            clean and elegant showcase website. The accent colour I
            choose was Dark moderate cyan.. Later on while project was
            in design phase I chamged the theme from Cyan to Gradient feel,
            to make it more contrast and modern feel.
            I decided to use red as theme colour

        Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person,
        indicating what actions are possible, what is happening, and what is about to happen.
