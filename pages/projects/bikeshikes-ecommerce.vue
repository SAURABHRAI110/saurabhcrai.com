      to navigate, Lots of technical words without much context which frustrated

       Impact: <br>
The website makes users feel engaged with lots of product to explore with modern, simple and intuitive design.

Our target users shared that the design was intuitive to navigate through, more engaging with the images, and demonstrated a clear visual hierarchy and users were able to easily sort products according to their need.
 
      <br>
      <br>
      What I learned:<br>
I learned that even a small design change can have a huge impact on the user experience. The most important takeaway for me is to always focus on the real needs of the user when coming up with design ideas and solutions.

            After layout and content strategy, It was time to set a
            theme and colour palette It was time to design a simple,
            clean and elegant showcase website. The accent colour I
            choose was Dark moderate cyan.. Later on while project was
            in design phase I chamged the theme from Cyan to Gradient feel,
            to make it more contrast and modern feel.
            I decided to use red as theme colour
